## Overview of Analysis

The purpose of this analysis was to explore unsupervised machine learning. The data for this analysis was from the crypto_data.csv and contained a bunch of data about various cryptocurrencies. This project used different means of clustering data and reducing dimensions with PCA (principal component analysis) to create a report of whaat cryptocurrencies are trading on the market and how they can be grouped into a classification system for investment purposes. The data for this project was cleaned and processed and reduced using PCA then clustered using the K-means algorithm and finally visualized using a 3-D scatter plot.
